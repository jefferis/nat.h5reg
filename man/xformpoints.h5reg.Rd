\title{Map points using h5 registrations}
\usage{
\method{xformpoints}{h5reg}(reg, points, ..., method = c("auto", "java", "rjava"))
}
\arguments{
\item{reg}{A \code{\link{h5reg}} object specifying one or more h5
registrations.}

\item{points}{An Nx3 matrix of 3D points to transform}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to java transform tool (currently
ignored).}

\item{method}{Whether to shell out to java executable (\code{method='java'})
or use the rJava package (\code{method='rjava'}). The default
(\code{method='auto'}) uses rJava if installed. See Java section for
implications of this choice.}
}
\value{
An Nx3 matrix of transformed points
}
\description{
Map points using h5 registrations

\details{
See \code{\link{h5reg}} for details of the ordering of
  registrations.

\section{Java}{
 By default \code{xformpoints.h5reg} starts a separate Java
  Virtual Machine (JVM) for every call. This has an overhead that might be in
  the 0.5s range, which quickly builds up. Alternatively, you can use
  \code{method='rjava'}, which depends on the 'rJava' package; since rJava
  can be a little fiddly to install, this is only a suggested dependency.
  Using rJava transparently starts a single JVM session from R and then
  reuses that, substantially speeding up the situation when you have many
  small objects to transform. It is also somewhat more efficient in terms of
  disk/CPU since points are retained in memory rather than written out as
  text files. However in my hands this has limited impact on the elapsed
  time.
